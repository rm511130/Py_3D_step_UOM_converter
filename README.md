# Py_3D_step_UOM_converter
Units converter for a part in a STEP file

Great! I’ll put together a cross-platform command-line program that can:
- Detect or ask for the current unit of a STEP file.
- Convert the geometry to a different unit (scaling as needed).
- Save the converted file with a clear name (e.g., `ABC (inch-to-mm).step`).
- Work on both Windows via WSL and macOS.

I’ll get started and will follow up shortly with the tool and setup instructions.

# STEP File Unit Conversion CLI Tool

## Overview  
Converting the units of a CAD model in a STEP file requires adjusting the model’s scale and updating the file’s unit metadata. This tool (`stepconvert`) is a cross-platform command-line program written in Python (using the PythonOCC library) that automates unit conversion for STEP (`.step/.stp`) files. It can detect the original units from the STEP file’s header and scale the 3D geometry to new units without altering the shape. The output is a new STEP file labeled with the converted units. PythonOCC (Python OpenCASCADE) provides robust STEP import/export functionality ([pythonOCC – 3D CAD for python](https://pythonocc1.rssing.com/chan-6609274/all_p1.html#:~:text=pythonOCC%20comes%20with%20importers%2Fexporters%20for,ABB%2C%20STEP%20file%C2%A0downloaded%C2%A0from%C2%A0the%20ABB%20Library)), allowing the tool to work on Windows (including WSL) and macOS.

## Features and Requirements  
- **Unit Detection**: The tool reads the STEP file’s header to determine the original length units. STEP files include unit definitions (e.g. “INCH”, “MILLIMETRE”) in their data section. For example, a STEP file in inches might contain lines defining the inch unit and its conversion to SI ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=,22339%29%20LENGTH_UNIT)). If the original unit cannot be inferred, the tool will prompt the user to specify it.  
- **Supported Units**: Conversion is supported among inches, feet, yards, miles, millimeters, centimeters, meters, and kilometers. These options can be passed via command-line arguments or interactively selected. *(Note: OpenCASCADE’s STEP exporter directly supports most of these units (inch, foot, mile, millimeter, centimeter, meter, kilometer, etc.) but not “yard” as a named unit ([Step file unit - Forum Open Cascade Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/content/step-file-unit#:~:text=If%20you%20will%20grep%20OCCT,FOOT)). The tool handles yards as a special case, described below.)*  
- **Geometry Scaling**: The entire 3D geometry is uniformly scaled to the target units, so the model’s actual size remains the same in real-world terms – only the numeric values and unit designation change. For instance, converting from inches to millimeters scales all coordinates by 25.4 (since 1 inch = 25.4 mm) ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=PLANE_ANGLE_UNIT%28%29%20SI_UNIT%28%24%2C)). The shape and proportions are preserved.  
- **Output Naming**: The converted file is saved with a name indicating the conversion (e.g. `part (inches-to-millimeters).step`). This helps track the unit transformations applied.  
- **Cross-Platform CLI**: The script uses Python’s standard libraries (`argparse` for CLI arguments) and PythonOCC for CAD operations, making it usable on Windows (via WSL or native Python) and macOS. Installation of dependencies is handled via pip or conda (e.g. `pip install pythonocc-core` installs the OpenCASCADE Python bindings ([CAD Automation & 3D Geometries Processing via Open Source Python Library](https://products.fileformat.com/3d/python/pythonocc-core/#:~:text=Install%20PythonOCC))). No additional manual configuration is needed.

## Implementation Details  

### Parsing STEP Unit Metadata  
A STEP file contains a **header section** with unit specifications. The tool opens the file in text mode and searches for known unit keywords. It looks for unit entries such as: 
- **Imperial units**: `'INCH'`, `'FOOT'`, `'YARD'`, `'MILE'` appearing in `CONVERSION_BASED_UNIT` definitions ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=,22339%29%20LENGTH_UNIT)). For example, a line `CONVERSION_BASED_UNIT('INCH',#123)` indicates the file uses inches (with a later reference defining `1 inch = 25.4 mm`).  
- **Metric units**: occurrences of `SI_UNIT` with prefixes `.MILLI.,.METRE.`, `.CENTI.,.METRE.`, `.KILO.,.METRE.` for millimeter, centimeter, kilometer, or `.METRE.` with no prefix for meter. Some STEP files use explicit names like `'MILLIMETRE'` as a conversion-based unit ([www.steptools.com](https://www.steptools.com/docs/stpfiles/ap203/as1_pe.stp#:~:text=1505%3DLENGTH_MEASURE_WITH_UNIT%28LENGTH_MEASURE%2825.4%29%2C,1507)), which the tool also recognizes.  

If a match is found, the original unit is identified. If not (or if the file is ambiguous), the script falls back to prompting the user (`--from` argument or interactive input) to choose the source units.

### Computing the Scale Factor  
After determining the original and target units, the tool computes the scaling factor. A dictionary of conversion factors to meters is used internally. For example: 
```python
units_to_m = {
    "inches": 0.0254,    # 1 inch = 0.0254 m
    "feet": 0.3048,      # 1 foot = 0.3048 m
    "yards": 0.9144,     # 1 yard = 0.9144 m
    "miles": 1609.344,   # 1 mile = 1609.344 m
    "millimeters": 0.001, # 1 mm = 0.001 m
    "centimeters": 0.01,  # 1 cm = 0.01 m
    "meters": 1.0,        # 1 m = 1 m
    "kilometers": 1000.0  # 1 km = 1000 m
}
```  
The scale factor to apply to the geometry = `(original_unit_to_meters) / (target_unit_to_meters)`. For instance, converting from inches to millimeters: factor = 0.0254 / 0.001 = **25.4**. Converting from mm to feet: factor = 0.001 / 0.3048 ≈ **0.00328084** (since 1 mm is 0.00328084 feet). This factor is used to scale the 3D coordinates.

### Scaling the Geometry with OpenCASCADE  
The tool uses PythonOCC to import the STEP file’s geometry into a `TopoDS_Shape` object. PythonOCC’s STEP reader loads the shape (using OpenCASCADE’s STEPControl_Reader), and by default it interprets all geometry in SI units (millimeters) internally. The detected original unit informs how we interpret the shape’s scale. 

To adjust the geometry, we apply a uniform scaling transformation on the shape. Using OpenCASCADE’s transformation API, we create a scaling transformation about the origin (0,0,0) with the computed factor. For example: 
```python
from OCC.Core.gp import gp_Trsf, gp_Pnt
from OCC.Core.BRepBuilderAPI import BRepBuilderAPI_Transform

trsf = gp_Trsf()
trsf.SetScale(gp_Pnt(0,0,0), scale_factor)
scaled_shape = BRepBuilderAPI_Transform(original_shape, trsf, True).Shape()
``` 
This yields a new shape with all coordinates scaled. If the original was in inches and target in mm, `scale_factor = 25.4` will enlarge the shape by 25.4× (so an object that was 1 inch in the original file becomes 25.4 mm in the new shape, which is the same physical length). Conversely, converting mm to inches uses a factor of ~0.03937 to shrink the coordinates (so 25.4 mm becomes 1.0 in the new shape, interpreted as 1 inch).

**Note:** We scale relative to the global origin to preserve the model’s placement. This means the entire model, including its position in space, is converted to the new unit system consistently. All parts of an assembly (if present) are scaled together when combined as a single compound shape.

### Writing the STEP File with New Units  
After scaling, the tool exports the shape to a STEP file using PythonOCC’s STEPControl_Writer. Before writing, it sets the desired unit in the STEP export parameters provided by OpenCASCADE. For example, to set the output units to meters:  
```python
from OCC.Core.Interface import Interface_Static_SetCVal
Interface_Static_SetCVal("write.step.unit", "M")
```  
OpenCASCADE supports unit codes for writing STEP files such as `"INCH"`, `"MM"` (millimeters), `"FT"` (feet), `"MI"` (miles), `"M"` (meters), `"KM"` (kilometers), `"CM"` (centimeters), etc. ([Step file unit - Forum Open Cascade Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/content/step-file-unit#:~:text=,%2F%2F%206)) ([Export STEP file with name · Issue #482 · tpaviot/pythonocc-core · GitHub](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core/issues/482#:~:text=Interface_Static_SetCVal%28%27write,assembly_mode)). The tool maps the target unit to the appropriate code. (For instance, “millimeters” -> `"MM"`, “feet” -> `"FT"`, “inches” -> `"INCH"`, etc.) Then the writer is invoked to produce the output file. OpenCASCADE will automatically include the correct unit metadata in the STEP file header and scale the numeric values if the unit is not the default. For example, writing with `"INCH"` will insert the proper conversion factors so that the output file is recognized as inch-units ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=,22339%29%20LENGTH_UNIT)), and coordinates are divided by 25.4 (since our shape was in mm) to appear as inch values. 

**Handling Yards**: The one unit not directly supported by OpenCASCADE’s writer is yards (there is no `"YARD"` code in `write.step.unit` settings ([Step file unit - Forum Open Cascade Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/content/step-file-unit#:~:text=If%20you%20will%20grep%20OCCT,FOOT))). The tool addresses this by converting the geometry to meters (since 1 yard = 0.9144 m) and labeling the file in meters. This ensures the physical size is correct (a 1-yard length in the original will be 0.9144 m in the output). The limitation is that the STEP file will report “meter” as the unit. In practice, many CAD programs do not use yards natively, so using meters as an equivalent may be acceptable. (Future versions of the tool could directly inject a conversion-based “YARD” unit in the STEP header manually, but PythonOCC/OpenCASCADE do not provide this out-of-the-box.)

**Key points about the code**:  
- It uses `detect_units()` to parse the file’s text for unit identifiers ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=,22339%29%20LENGTH_UNIT)).  
- The `units_to_m` dictionary defines the conversion to a common reference (meters). This ensures high precision conversion factors (e.g. 0.3048 for a foot) are used.  
- PythonOCC’s `STEPControl_Reader` reads the file into a shape. We call `TransferRoots()` and then take `OneShape()` which gives a combined shape (if the file has an assembly, it will produce a compound of all parts).  
- We normally let OpenCASCADE handle the unit scaling when writing (by setting `write.step.unit`). To avoid double-scaling, the code sets `manual_scale = False` for all standard unit conversions and relies on the writer’s built-in conversion. (If needed, one could force manual scaling by setting that flag True, but it’s not necessary for supported units.) For unsupported “yards”, we simply use the fallback approach described earlier.  
- The writer is configured for STEP AP203 by default (common standard; AP214 or AP242 could be used as needed). We map the target unit to the code expected by OpenCASCADE (as gleaned from documentation ([Step file unit - Forum Open Cascade Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/content/step-file-unit#:~:text=,%2F%2F%206))). The writer then produces the output file.  
- The script prints a confirmation with the original and target units and output file path for user feedback.

## Installation and Setup  
To use this tool, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. The primary dependency is **pythonocc-core** (PythonOCC bindings for OpenCASCADE). You can install it via pip: 

```bash
pip install pythonocc-core
``` 

This will install OpenCASCADE and PythonOCC on your system ([CAD Automation & 3D Geometries Processing via Open Source Python Library](https://products.fileformat.com/3d/python/pythonocc-core/#:~:text=Install%20PythonOCC)). Alternatively, you can use Conda: 

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pythonocc-core
``` 

No additional packages are required beyond the standard library. If you save the above code to a file (e.g. `stepconvert.py`), you can run it directly with the Python interpreter. On Linux/macOS, you might add a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) and make it executable. On Windows (or WSL), just invoke `python stepconvert.py ...` as needed. 

## Usage Examples  

1. **Automatic Unit Detection** – Suppose you have a STEP file created in inches, `bracket_inch.step`. You want to convert it to millimeters. Simply run:  
   ```bash
   $ python stepconvert.py bracket_inch.step --to millimeters
   ```  
   The tool will read the file, detect that it uses inches (for example, by finding `INCH` in the file header ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=,22339%29%20LENGTH_UNIT))), and apply the conversion to millimeters. The output might be `bracket_inch (inches-to-millimeters).step`. All geometry will be scaled up by 25.4×, and the new STEP file’s units will be set to millimeters. Any CAD program opening the new file will see the model in mm with correct dimensions. For instance, a 2-inch hole (50.8 mm) in the original will measure 50.8 mm in the converted file. The tool prints:  

   ```
   Converted bracket_inch.step (inches → millimeters) -> bracket_inch (inches-to-millimeters).step
   ```  

2. **User-Specified Original Units** – If a file’s units are not embedded or not recognized, you can specify them with `--from`. For example, some STEP files may default to mm without explicit mention; if you know the file is actually in feet, you can do:  
   ```bash
   $ python stepconvert.py model.step --from feet --to meters -o model_feet_to_m.step
   ```  
   This will treat `model.step` as being in feet and convert to meters. Every coordinate will be multiplied by 0.3048 (since 1 foot = 0.3048 m), effectively shrinking the numeric values so that a distance of 1.0 in the original (1 foot) becomes 0.3048 in the output (0.3048 m) – the physical size is unchanged. The output file `model_feet_to_m.step` will be in meters. If no `-o` is given, the default name would be `model (feet-to-meters).step`.  

3. **Interactive Prompt** – If neither detection nor `--from` is provided, the script will prompt for the original unit. For example:  
   ```bash
   $ python stepconvert.py assembly.step --to kilometers
   Original unit not found in file. Please specify one of [inches, feet, yards, miles, millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers]: 
   ```  
   If you enter `meters` (or an abbreviation like `m`), the tool will proceed to convert the assembly from meters to kilometers. All dimensions will be divided by 1000, and the output file will be labeled in kilometers.  

4. **Yard Conversion** – Converting to yards works, but with a caveat. For instance:  
   ```bash
   $ python stepconvert.py design.step --to yards
   ```  
   The tool will output a file (e.g., `design (meters-to-yards).step` if original was meters) that is scaled to yard units in size (1 yard in original = 1 yard in new file physically) but will declare its units as meters. In other words, 1 yard will appear as 0.9144 m in the file. This ensures correct geometry scale, but the unit label in the STEP file is “meter” due to library limitations. You may manually interpret or change it if necessary. The conversion of all other supported units is fully faithful, as the library directly embeds the correct unit identifiers for those ([Step file unit - Forum Open Cascade Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/content/step-file-unit#:~:text=,%2F%2F%206)). 

By following the above examples, you can reliably convert 3D models between imperial and metric units. This helps integrate models from different measurement systems while preserving their actual dimensions. The use of an open-source CAD kernel (OpenCASCADE via PythonOCC) and standard Python libraries makes the solution transparent and extensible for future improvements. 

**References:** The approach to detect and set units is based on the STEP format specification and OpenCASCADE’s capabilities. STEP files explicitly list their measurement units in the data section (as shown in a Rhino forum snippet) ([STEP files units? - Rhino for Windows - McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/step-files-units/110788#:~:text=,22339%29%20LENGTH_UNIT)). We leveraged OpenCASCADE’s STEP importer/exporter which supports AP203/AP214 and unit conversions ([pythonOCC – 3D CAD for python](https://pythonocc1.rssing.com/chan-6609274/all_p1.html#:~:text=pythonOCC%20comes%20with%20importers%2Fexporters%20for,ABB%2C%20STEP%20file%C2%A0downloaded%C2%A0from%C2%A0the%20ABB%20Library)) ([Export STEP file with name · Issue #482 · tpaviot/pythonocc-core · GitHub](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core/issues/482#:~:text=Interface_Static_SetCVal%28%27write,assembly_mode)). According to OpenCASCADE documentation, supported output units include inch, millimeter, foot, mile, meter, kilometer, etc., mapped via the `write.step.unit` parameter ([Step file unit - Forum Open Cascade Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/content/step-file-unit#:~:text=,%2F%2F%206)). The PythonOCC library conveniently exposes these features, enabling us to build the conversion tool with minimal reinventing of STEP parsing logic.
